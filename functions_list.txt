Q:
1. Implement CancelablePromise ?
2. Support for test nets ?
3. XPUB always generated for ETH net ?  But what about other chains ??
5. Local wallet for Tron, BNB, Terra ?
6. Propagate error from API to SDK (now they are replaced) - may use source mechanics - specify errors for every command
7. Local prepare TX for Tron, BNB, Terra, Aptos, Polka (not possible) ?
8. Teach SDK work without loaded coins (just by contract address) ?

    SDK functions

    Local
+ 3. Generate Mnemonic
+ 4. Get XPUB from mnemonic
+ 5. Generate Wallet from mnemonic (online/offline)
+/- 6. Generate Address from xpub (with index) (supported not for all networks!)
+ 12. Get address from pkey
+/- 17. Prepare transaction (only in SDK?) (or API ?)
- 17.1. Serialize transaction
+ 18. Sign transaction (only in SDK?) (or API ?)
+ 20. Add descriptions to public functions (!)
21. Check balance function
22. Function to create aptos account
! 4.1. Get XPUB different for each network !
17.2. Implement Solana SPL transaction prepare

    API calls
+ 1. Get Supported Networks: GET /info/networks (API-call)
+ 1.1. Get Supported Tokens: GET /info/tokens/{network} (API-call)
+ 7. Get Balance (API-call)
+ 8. Get Token balance (API-call)
+ 9. Get all tokens (API-call)
+ 11. Get last block (API-call)
+ 13. Get block by hash/number (API-call)
+ 10. Get transaction by hash (API-call)
+ 14. Get count of outgoing transactions (nonce) ? (API-call)
+/- 16. Send Transaction (not tested) (API-call)
+/- 21. Broadcast signed transaction (not tested - ) (API-call)
22. Enable nodes and tokens caching
23. Enable initializing only specific nodes

    KMS !
+ 1. Local storage to start with
+ 2. Encrypted local JSON file

    Test broadcasting
1. APTOS (building works)
2. Binance (BNB) (not work serializing - some error in params)
3. Bitcoin (btc, ltc, doge) - fully work
4. EVM - fully work
5. Polka (building works) - not able to serialize tx

6. Radix - fully work
7. Solana - fully work ( only for SOL )
8. Terra - fully work
9. Tron - fully work
